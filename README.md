# Ranboard

A simple soundboard app which plays random sounds(not provided) at random times based on keystrokes.

## Missing features / TODO list

- Settings do not currently save
- No way to set 2 audio devices(hear audio and also send to virtual audio cable)

## Disclaimer

This is just a quick project I made for a friend, do not expect this to be the best/most effiecent way of doing this, it was just a fun thing to make.

## Licensing

Feel free to modify and use this code(although its kinda messy), just dont claim it entirely as your own because its not.
