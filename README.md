### Disclaimer

This is just a quick project I made for a friend, do not expect this to be the best/most effiecent way of doing this, it was just a fun thing to make.

#### Licensing

Feel free to modify and use this code(although its kinda messy), just don't claim it entirely as your own because it's not.
